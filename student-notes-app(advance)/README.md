## 🙋‍♀️ About the Developer

Developed by **Saniya** —  
Hi there GitHub! Just a normal average BCA student trying her level best to improve herself and *not* pull her hair out from all the errors 😭.

My interests are in the field of:  
1. Data analytics (interest only… haven't started working on it yet lol!)  
2. Back-end development  
3. Living a drama-free life (but if you have tea, give me some too 👀☕)

## ⭐ Future Improvements

- Add dark mode  
- Add password reset  
- Add note sharing  
- Add profile section
